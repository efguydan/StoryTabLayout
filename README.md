## Preview

## Gradle Dependency

StoryTabLayout is hosted on MavenCentral. To add to your project, include `mavenCentral()` to your repositories and then add the dependency to your moduleâ€™s build.gradle.

```groovy
implementation 'io.github.efguydan:StoryTabLayout:<insert-version-here>'
```

For versions, check [here](https://github.com/efguydan/StoryTabLayout/releases) for the releases.

## Usage

Add `StoryTabLayout` to your layout file.

```xml
<com.efedaniel.storytablayout.StoryTabLayout
  android:id="@+id/storyTabLayout"
  android:layout_width="match_parent"
  android:layout_height="wrap_content" />
```

Then you need to setup the Story Tab Layout with a `ViewPager`, `ViewPager2`, or with a custom number of Tabs. 

```kotlin
fun setupStoryTabLayout() {
  // Set up with a ViewPager
  storyTabLayout.setupWithViewPager(viewPager)

  // Set up with a ViewPager2
  storyTabLayout.setupWithViewPager2(viewPager2)

  // Set up with Number of Tabs
  storyTabLayout.setupWithNumberOfTabs(numberOfTabs = 10, initialPage = 5)
}
```

>If you are setting up with a ViewPager / ViewPager2, you should make sure your adapter is setup before calling the setup method.
>
>If you are setting up with Number of Tabs, the initial Page argument is optional and has a default value of 0.

After that, you just need to call the start method and voila!

```kotlin
fun setupStoryTabLayout() {
  // Start the Story Tab Layout
  storyTabLayout.start()
}
```
